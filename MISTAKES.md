# List of mistakes

* I was't shure would I maintain project on Qt, so there were a lot of wrappers:
they made code more ugly, and UI was very plain

* I didn't use any libraries and did try dont use Qt as possible

* There was a concept of AbstractMusic that contained sepparation of melody, harmony and rhythm, nice idea for musical analysis, but it took a lot of time, and hard to maintain

* Own file format was done to be smaller then gtp files, but it took longer to write and maintain it: best option is to make json tab format, that could be reused in other apps

* There was attepmt to read also ptb and te files, but they are minor file types for guitar tabs

* I put my trust in every single man who said that he would help, and spent a lot of time to bring them information, in fact only 3-4 people really helped in project

* I planned to make project opensource from the begining, but was shy to open it, it had to be opened many years ago, so people can join me

* Running for new features, quite often leaving them in state proof on concept, then running for next one

* Rarely made refactoring
