Tablature editor

It can read guitar pro files 3, 4, 5. Generate midi and pcm from them.
And also it can read an write files in out format.

Additional inputs availible.

Projects was abadoned for years, there where done a lot of mistakes, but still I have a hope to recover it, and make a free tablature solution for mobile and desktop.
