It can read guitar pro files 3, 4, 5. Generate midi and pcm from them.
And also it can read an write files in out format.

Additional inputs availible.

For now project is abadoned. But I would return back to it. There was done alot of mistakes because I wasn't sure I would leave it on Qt.
There is another closed repository with QML version, to be opened later.


# Personal Histroy

First signs of this project appeared in 2009, when I wrote and built Sony PSP homebrew application, that was capable to read and write GP4 file. Playback was very laggy but some of file worked just fine.

After working with automatic transcription there was a plan to unite this projects.

Current version of project began in summer 2014, development continued till 2016 year.

There were a lot of dramatic events around me those years. People who I've trusted betrayed me just when I started to work on the project, and needed help and health, rather depression.

I had a promise of investment into this project, but the person who gave it passed away on summer 2017. It broke my heart, and for a years project remain untouched.
